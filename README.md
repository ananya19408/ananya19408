# piano-tiles

This is game developed as a part of the prototyping interactive systems course in my 1st semester.
in this game there are 2 tiles with lights,as soon as the light on one tile lights up the player has to stand on it and this continues with the light 
the speed and pattern increasing and changing.As soon as you step on the wrong tile,the game ends,else you score points.
